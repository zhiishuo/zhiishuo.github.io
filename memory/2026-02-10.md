## Durable preferences / decisions
- User prefers concise coordination: only send a confirmation message when a task is truly finished; avoid frequent in-progress chatter unless blocked.
- Primary chat channel is iMessage; working contact uses `+8618581515281` (with +86 format).
- User accepted keeping a single OpenClaw setup for now (did not proceed with dual-daemon / dual-agent iMessage split yet).
- For voice replies on iMessage, user expects voice-like behavior; current practical path is audio attachment (not native iMessage voice bubble).

## Website work (durable state)
- Correct personal-site repo/user is `zhiishuo/zhiishuo.github.io`.
- Site publication target confirmed as `https://zhiishuo.github.io/`.
- User requested and approved iterative refinements:
  - keep/restore News (paper updates)
  - remove Portfolio section
  - harmonize Contact colors
  - use image `IMG_7063.jpg` as hero photo (latest explicit request)
- Final pushes were made to `origin` pointing at `git@github.com:zhiishuo/zhiishuo.github.io.git`.

## Product/assistant workflow
- User wants assistant to support entrepreneurship planning and execution, but with minimal overhead communication.
- User asked for stronger English-learning support and actionable daily structure.
- Communication preference clarified: avoid frequent progress pings; only send a clear confirmation when the task is truly finished (unless blocked and user action is required).

## Late-session additions
- User asked for tri-goal SelfOS upgrade focused on Research/English/Fitness and accepted completion summary for V4.
- User requested remote viewing and asked about waking/unlocking screen:
  - wake signal can be sent remotely,
  - unlocking screen must remain user-authenticated (password/Face ID/Touch ID).
- User requested checking X hot topics with no commenting; preference is concise factual digest only.

## SelfOS app
- User requested upgrading personal tracking app to tri-goal structure: Research / English / Fitness.
- V4 upgrade was completed and shared with user for review (`http://127.0.0.1:8080/` local preview during run).
